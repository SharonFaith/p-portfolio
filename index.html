              <p>My name is Sharon Faith. I am a relatively quiet person until someone gets to know me well, which is a trait many quiet people seem to possess. I finished High School in 2018. I can speak three languages: English, Swahili, French

              <p>I had been interested in learning programming skills at a point during the course of this year. Having learned of the existence of <em>Moringa School </em>previously through an acquaintance and through online research, I was excited to learn that they had an upcoming intake. I joined Moringa school because in my opinion, programming is an essential skill in this day and age that gives one an extra edge. Software technologies are applied in almost all professions, so whatever one's future or current career path, gaining knowledge in programming is not off the mark.</p>
